## Summary

Achieving global biodiversity targets requires translating international commitments into effective national actions. In 2022, 196 parties agreed to protect 30% of the planet by 2030 under the Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF). However, concerns remain over whether current protected areas (PAs) are ecologically effective and socially equitable.

This project focuses on Ethiopia—a country with globally important biodiversity but high levels of poverty and food insecurity. 

We provide a comprehensive national-scale evaluation of Ethiopia’s progress towards the multiple dimensions of the 30-by-30 target. We assess the extent of Ethiopia’s protected area network and how well it represents national ecoregions and species. We then apply a robust quasi-experimental approach to assess both environmental (forest, agriculture and grassland cover change) and human wellbeing (change in months of adequate food, dietary diversity and material wellbeing) impacts of Ethiopia’s protected areas. Considering protected areas individually, we then examine whether funding allocation is a predictor of performance across environmental and social outcomes. Finally, we explore the views of key national stakeholders in conservation policy and practice and consider the alignment of national priorities and global goals. The research highlights the very real challenges faced by those tasked with turning a global commitment into reality on the ground.
